   <h4>Morocco</h4>
   
   <P>Morocco is a beautiful amazing country with surprises and magic around every corner. Chefchaouen and Rabat is a must see and I wish we could’ve spend more days exploring these mystical phenomenal cities. The Riad in Rabat was outstanding and gave us a true experience of being part of Morocco.

    The people of Morocco are kind hearted and friendly people and we always felt safe and welcome.
    
    This was a truly unforgettable experience and I would recommend everyone to experience it at least once. ”  </P>

    <h6>MALTA</h6>


    <p>One of the biggest reasons to visit Malta is its most famous cities, which are like big open-air history museums.

     <br>The capital Valletta was founded by the Knights of St John (Knights Hospitaller) in the 16th century. <br>Many of the buildings they’ve built are still standing today, granting Valletta the title of a UNESCO World Heritage Site./p>
